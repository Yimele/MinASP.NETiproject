Design and develop a mini-project of your choice which encompasses the following components:
 
1.      A database containing at least 2 tables (SQL Azure or Oracle or mySQL)
2.      An ASP.Net MVC 5 application which maintains the data in that database table i.e. CRUD using the Entity Framework (code first approach)
3.      A RESTful web service which provides access to some piece of analysis of the data stored in the database table, one operation will suffice.
4.      A simple console client app for the web service which calls the operation and displays the result of the analysis.
 
Design and implement the project. Develop some unit tests for the logic of the application. Use GitHub to manage the project and its source code.
 
Deploy the web application and web service on Azure. Scale. 
 
Before proceeding specify the functionality of the system and submit to GC for vetting before proceeding. Also indicate the team members. If you are not in a team you will randomly assigned to a team.
